# Bank-Marketing-Campaign---Subscription-Analysis
PowerBI Dashboard analyzing customer subscription behaviour using UCI Bank Marketing Dataset

Project Overview
This project analyzes the Bank Marketing Campaign dataset to understand customer behavior and identify key factors that drive subscription to term deposits.

The analysis was performed using *Power BI*, with several DAX measures and visualizations to extract insights.

Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Removed duplicates (using customer ID & contact history).
   - Created *Balance Categories* using statistical thresholds.
   - Derived new measures for subscription rate, average duration, and calls per subscription.

2. Dashboard Development:
   - KPIs: Total Customers, Unique Customers, Subscription Rate, Calls per Subscription.
   - Visuals: Balance vs Subscriptions, Campaign Effectiveness, Monthly Trends, Customer Demographics.

3. Insights:
   - Majority of customers fall into Low Balance Category.
   - Subscription rate is relatively low (~12%).
   - Longer call durations are positively correlated with higher subscription chances.
